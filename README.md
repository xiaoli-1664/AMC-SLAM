# Asynchronous Multi-Camera SLAM Using Sparse Gaussian Process Regression

**Abstract**: Conventional VSLAM systems frequently experience drift and tracking failures in complex environments, which limits their overall effectiveness. Multi-camera systems have enhanced VSLAM accuracy by incorporating diverse viewpoints, but they generally rely on synchronous data capture, restricting their applicability in multi-sensor setups where asynchronous data acquisition is necessary. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous-time Asynchronous Multi-Camera SLAM (AMC-SLAM) framework using sparse Gaussian process regression. Our method integrates outlier removal, continuous-time trajectory optimization, and multi-view loop closing to achieve robust pose estimation. By combining Gaussian process interpolation with bundle adjustment, our approach strengthens inter-camera data correlation and reduces state variables, while our derived analytical Jacobians enhance optimization efficiency. Experimental results on the AMV-Bench dataset demonstrate absolute translation error below 0.5% over a 10 km trajectory, indicating significant accuracy improvements over existing stereo and multi-camera SLAM systems. These findings underscore the potential of AMC-SLAM for high-precision, robust applications in challenging environments.
